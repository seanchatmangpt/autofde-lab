"""DMEDI curriculum module: DEVELOP phase -- "Mixture Designs".

Real curriculum source: Design for Lean Six Sigma Black Belt (DMEDI:
Define, Measure, Explore, Develop, Implement). This file is a real,
honestly-scoped planner-module placeholder in
autofde-lab's laboratory pipeline (src/autofde_lab/reasoning/laboratory.py):
it is NOT yet implemented. It exists to admit "Mixture Designs" as a real,
named, tracked module in the curriculum -- not to fake having built it.

Per this repo's own no-overclaiming discipline (see laboratory.py's
FalsificationStanding.UNSUPPORTED / OperatorApplicabilityStatus patterns):
calling plan_mixture_designs() raises NotImplementedError explicitly and loudly.
There is no silent stub that returns a fabricated ArchitectureCandidate.
